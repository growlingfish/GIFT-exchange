# GIFT Exchange App

To help museums (and developers who work for museums) to make use of the [GIFT Platform](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/gift-platform/), we provide the [GIFT Toolbox](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/tools/). The tools in the GIFT Toolbox are split according to the different stages of developing a hybrid gifting experience.

The GIFT Exchange App is a mobile app built on the Ionic Framework, suitable for use on Android devices. This version allows users to create, send and receive [hybrid gifts](https://toolkit.gifting.digital/what-are-hybrid-gifts/) via the public instance of the GIFT Platform maintained by the GIFT project. To use this version please search for "Gift Exchange tool" on the Google Play store and download the app to your device.

To use this version as the basis for your own app, please clone the repository and use Ionic to update/fix dependencies first. As it is, the app relies on a number of packages that were free-to-use at the time it was released.

## The GIFT project

GIFT is a [research project funded by Horizon 2020](https://gift.itu.dk/), exploring hybrid forms of virtual museum experiences. The project brings together artists, designers, museum professionals and computer scientists to help museums create personal encounters with cultural heritage, both in physical and digital realms.
