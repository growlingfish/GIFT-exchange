        What data do we collect?
      </ion-card-header>
  
      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
          We may collect information about Users and content that can be connected to Users ("User data") when they use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <strong>registering an account</strong> Users are asked for a name and email address. When Users make and receive Gifts, the various <strong>interactions with the Gifts</strong> are logged. When <strong>making Gifts for other Users</strong>, Users are free to include text and photographs that may reveal personal data. When Users receive Gifts they are free to include personal data in a <strong>response to the Gift</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can always refuse to supply User data: this may prevent them from engaging in certain App-related activities.

        How do we use your data?
      </ion-card-header>
  
      <ion-card-content>
        <p>We may use Users personal information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To personalise the User experience</strong>: the App may automatically use User data to customise the User experience, e.g. to provide the User with a history of their interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>To improve the App and understand gifting behaviour</strong>: we may use User data to improve our products and services, and to build a body of academic knowledge on the ways in which people create and react to Gifts. Venues where the Gift app is used may use User data to understand how the App can benefit the visiting experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User data is shared in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Between Users</strong>: when a User creates a Gift they may choose to share that Gift and any associated personal data with another User; Users may also view a list of all registered Users.</li>
          <li><strong>Within the GIFT project team</strong>: Gifts and App interactions may be viewed and analysed individually and/or in aggregate by the academic members of the GIFT project team.</li>
          <li><strong>With Gift venues</strong>: anonymised and aggregated personal data may be viewed by the venues where the App is used.</li>
        </ul>

        How do we protect your data?
      </ion-card-header>
  
      <ion-card-content>
        <p>
          Sensitive and private data exchange between the App and our servers happens over a TLS private communication channel and is encrypted with digital signatures. Data is stored on servers located within the EU, accessible only by active academic members of the GIFT project team.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent User data to others. We may share generic aggregated information not linked to any personal identification information regarding individual Users with our research partners and funding partners as part of presentations and reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can request their data or request that their data is deleted at anytime by contacting the GIFT project team at any of the addresses below.
